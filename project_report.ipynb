    "Upon first impression, it may not be obvious that aritsts and machine learning algorithms have anything in common. While artists use their human creativity to develop something original, algorithms are only able to use the information that they've been given to predict what may happen if another similar piece of information is provided to them. However, upon further inspection, both rely heavily on a common ally: patterns. While artists like Claude Monet rely on similar brush strokes and models to create their distinctive style, machine learning algorithms rely on patterns in data to stay consistant in order to predict what might come next given never-before-seen observations. It might then be natural to wonder whether a machine learning algorithm could be trained on the patterns that an artist like Monet used in his art to create new \"paintings\" that imitate the same style. This is the problem presented in the Kaggle Competition, \"I'm Something of a Painter Myself\". Through the use of PyTorch's neural network software, we created a Generative Adversarial Network that modifies real-life photos into pictures that imitated an Impressionist painting style like that of Monet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will first describe the problem and the mechanics of GANs in greater detail. We will then detail our methods of creating these networks, including the software used, the issues faced, and the structure of our final model. Finally, we will provide examples of the \"paintings\" that our model created and discuss the accuracy of our imitations as well as how they might be improved upon."

    "In this competition, participants are provided with Monet paintings as well as real photos with scenery similar to that which Monet might have used as a model for his artwork, and attempt to turn these photos into the style of Monet using an algorithm called a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). GANs use dualing generator and discriminator models to create videos, music, photos, and other types of media [source] that closely imitate something that might have been created by a human; in this case, Claude Monet. These networks are best known due to their utility in creating \"deepfake\" videos[source], but are also used to create and/or imitate various forms of artwork. Competitors are judged based on the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) between their GAN created \"paintings\" and real Monet artworks. This FID between real images r and generated images g is computed as\n",
    "$$FID=||\\mu r−\\mu g||2+Tr(\\Sigma r+\\Sigma g−2(\\Sigma r \\Sigma g)1/2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where Tr is the sum of the diagonal elements [1]. FID, created in 2017, is commonly used to evaluate images created  by GAN networks by comparing the deeper features of the generated images with the true images rather than comparing pixel-by-pixel. Submissions with a small FID will be judged to have best imitated Monet paintings with their GAN model. 7,000 to 10,000 images must be generated and submitted, and these images must be in a $256 \\text{x} 256 \\text{x} 3$ format.\n",
    "\n",
    "To successfully complete this competition, teams must first create a GAN model in their software of choice. A GAN model is build from two separate machine learning models, a generator and a discriminator. The generator model is responsible for the creation of images, while the discriminator model learns to tell the difference between a generated painting and a true Monet painting. These models work against each other; the generator attempts to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator helps the generator improve by giving feedback as to whether the generated paintings can be told apart from the real Monets. The GAN will run for a specified number of epochs, at which time the GAN will be judged to have been trained. If properly trained, the GAN should then have the ability to create artwork which has a resemblance to its intended target; in this case, the Monet artwork. GANs can be created with several different software packages, but we chose to use the Pytorch package in Python as it allows for easy GPU acceleration which saves compute power and time."
