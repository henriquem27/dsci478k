    "At a first approximation, it may not be obvious that aritsts and machine learning algorithms have anything in common. While artists use their creativity and humanity to develop something original, algorithms are only able to use the information that they've been given to predict what may happen if another similar piece of information is provided to them. However, upon further inspection, both rely heavily on a common ally: patterns. While artists like Claude Monet rely on similar brush strokes and models to create their distinctive style, machine learning algorithms rely on patterns in data to stay consistant in order to predict what might come next given never-before-seen observations. It might then be natural to wonder whether a machine learning algorithm could be trained on the patterns that an artist like Monet used in his art to create new \"paintings\" that imitate the same style. This is the problem presented in the Kaggle Competition, \"I'm Something of a Painter Myself\". In this competition, participants are provided with Monet paintings as well as real photos with scenery similar to that which Monet might have used as a model for his artwork, and attempt to turn these photos into the style of Monet using an algorithm called a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). GANs use dualing generator and discriminator models to create videos, music, photos, or other types of media that closely imitate something that might have been created by a human; in this case, Monet. Through the use of PyTorch's neural network software, we were able to create generator and discriminator that modified real-life photos into pictures that imitated an Impressionist painting style.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we will first describe the problem and the mechanics of GANs in greater detail. We will then detail our methods of creating these networks, including the software used, the issues faced, and the structure of our final model. Finally, we will provide examples of the \"paintings\" that our model created and discuss the accuracy of our imitations as well as how they might be improved upon."
